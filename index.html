<a id="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h3>

<p>A traditional workbench… The place you go to when you want to make a project happen. These benches are robust, specialist and customisable, allowing you to create beautiful physical objects safely, quickly and methodically.</p>

<p>What’s the natural starting point for an IoT project…? It’s a bit digital, a bit physical, yet to be a success it has to merge these two worlds, be intuitive to set up and a delight to use. How do we create IoT prototypes and products safely, quickly and methodically with respect for a user’s privacy? How can we create a meaningful IoT?</p>

<p>The Open IoT Studio’s workbench is a little bit different from the traditional, it’s a digital resource for designers, developers,  technologists and user experience professionals working within the field of connected objects.</p>

<p>This workbench is a constantly evolving collection of best practice tools, methods and case studies from the projects that have been created during the Open IoT Studio convenings and by the practitioners within the studio. It’s a platform for sharing our research and the voices of our diverse community, but also a platform making this information openly available and easily accessible to the wider IoT community.</p>

<p>The workbench is a work in progress, and will be evolving throughout 2017. We'll be prototyping upgrades to the workbench on this site throughout 2017.</p>
